about: Create an issue with this template before starting a source build.

labels: Source
assignees: ''

## Build Notes
- For each issue, make sure to create a new branch and work on that issue's build tasks while on that branch. 
 branch template: `{issue_title}`
 example git branch creation command: `git checkout -b MS-search-amazon_us`
- Commit code for tasks as they are completed(if code was needed) to that issue's branch. When starting or continuing work on different issue, make sure to `git checkout master` and create a new branch from master, or `git checkout {branch_name}` if a. branch was already created. 
- Work on 2 or more issues at once, but make sure to commit changes and `git checkout {branch_name}` your other issue's branch prior to starting the other issue's tasks. This will help avoid merge conflicts.
- Include issue hash `#` in every commit message. Reference the build task in the commit message.
commit message template: `{build_task}`
example commit message command:
`git commit -m '#58. Created extractor robot.'`
- If your circle ci build fails, we will not merge your PR- you will see this in the 'Review Required ' section of your PR.
- Make sure that your branch is up to date. That you have pulled and merged master. You will see this in the same section.
- Use const/let instead of var
- Make sure to capitalize the country codes
- Use url parameterValue in the createUrl file instead of creating your own implementation
- When making a PR, the PR should be named after your branch ( i.e. `{issue_title}`)


## Communication Notes
- Before sending the dev team a question, ask someone on your team whether they have dealt with the issue, and google the error
- If thereâ€™s still an issue, instead of DMing the dev team, put it on the Slack `#ascential-mse-dsd` channel or on stack overflow
- If adding a bug or asking for help on Slack, please add the steps needed to reproduce and a link to this issue and a reference to the code commit where you are seeing the problem. Also please make sure to push up your latest changes.
