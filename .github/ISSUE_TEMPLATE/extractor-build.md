name: Check list for an extractor build
about: Create an issue with this template before starting a source build for a any feed type (search, core, media_tracker...)
title: "{feed_underscored_lowercase}-{retailer_name_camelcase}_{country_code_lowercase}, example: search-amazonPantry_us, core-mediaMarkt_de"
labels: Source
assignees: "@me"

---

## Pre-requisites
- Work on the corresponding retailer branch. If such branch does not exists then create it: `git checkout -b {retailer_name}` for the retailer syntax use only lower case and underscore instead of spaces.
- Only use one branch per retailer. Even if multiple feed type are on it.
- For development it is recommended to use VS code with the following optional extension: ESLint. Otherwise any IDE will work.
- Chrome must be installed
- The chrome extension [xpath helper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xpath-helper/hgimnogjllphhhkhlmebbmlgjoejdpjl) is a great help to identify xpaths

In here an issue corresponds to the development of a unique extractor: {feed_underscored}-{retailer_name}_{country code}

## Build Notes
- For each issue, make sure to use the retailer branch `{retailer_name}`
- Commit code for tasks as they are completed (if code was needed) to that issue's branch.
- It is mandatory that you include issue hash number `#{issue_number}` in every commit message
example commit message command:
`git commit -m '#58. Created extractor robot.'`
- If you work on 2 or more issues related to the same retailer, you do not need to change branch and can commit for both issues simultaneously.
example commit message command:
`git commit -m '#58#653 Changed goto code'`
- If you work on 2 or more issues that are from different retailers, you must change branch for each issue task with `git checkout {branch_name}` where `{branch_name}` is your other issue's branch. The change of branch must be done prior to starting the other issue's tasks
- If your circle ci build fails, we will not merge your PR- you will see this in the 'Review Required ' section of your PR.
- Make sure that your branch is up to date. That you have pulled and merged master. You will see this in the same section.
- Follow the linter and regulrlay run `npm run lint` to fix issues
- Make sure to capitalize the country codes
- When making a PR, the PR should be named after your branch ( i.e. `{issue_title}`)

## VERY IMPORTANT NOTES
- Try as much as possible to re-use code throughout the branch
- This means using a helper file which is re-used in multiple sources
- This means using the `extends` command in yaml file to re-use another file
- This means sharing the same transform.js wherever possible
- This means writing a single `goto.js` or `setZipcode.js` whenever such files are needed
- [Follow the best practises](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rofgekA37Wmj-RZH7wkp6KGjZ09qslUCUjaCJ-OCncU/edit#)

## Communication Notes
- Before sending the dev team a question, ask someone on your team whether they have dealt with the issue, look if a similar issue has been answered in [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/c/import-io) and google the error
- Ask your questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/c/import-io) so everyone can benefit from the answer
- If thereâ€™s still an issue, prefer using slack to emails
- If adding a bug, posting a question on SO or asking for help on Slack, please add the steps needed to reproduce. This means a link to the workbench source, a command to run locally, the name of the branch with your latest changes pushed to.

- [ ] Add label `Ready for internal review`
- [ ] Deploy extractor, this will generate an extractor ID located in a file called `exractor.yaml` within the orgs folder
`import-io extractor:deploy -o <workbench org slug> -p product/<first letter of retailer>/<retailerName>/<country code>/<extractor type> -b <team name>`
example:
`import-io extractor:deploy -o ascential -p product/d/dyson/NL/details -b importio`

- [ ] Upload sample input file to the appropriate path in the import.io AWS S3 bucket
- [ ] Implement PR feedback
- [ ] Commit latest code changes to branch with a commit message that includes the issue# (`#{:number}`)

`git checkout internal`
`git checkout -b {retailer_name-internal}`
Or pull from ealready existing branch  `git checkout {retailer_name-internal}` and fetch latest commit to be up to date with `internal` branch.
This branch is now used to commit new changes. Similarly as before, always reference the issue number in the commit message.
- [ ] Remove label `Ready for internal review`
