Gold - San Francisco World Spirits Competition 2016. Superb combination of rich sweetness, smoky dryness and appetising spice. Best served neat in a tumbler, perhaps with a little cool spring water. Slow distillation in small stills, cooled in worm tubs and matured for 14 years. An ideal gift for drinkers looking to explore Highland Single Malt Whiskies known for being rich in flavour and aroma. Oban is one of Scotland's oldest and smallest distilleries. It was founded in 1794 and the West Highland port town of the same name has grown around the distillery. It is the one Single Malt Scotch Whisky in which the rich, complex flavours of the Highlands meet and mingle with the peaty, maritime character of the Islands. Balancing autumn fruits and sea air, Oban whisky owes its rich and rewarding Highland character to its very long fermentation process. The tiny lamp glass-shaped copper pot stills that make Oban's Scotch are among the smallest in Scotland, and the liquor they distil is slowly condensed in wooden worm tubs outside among the rooftops, exposed to the salted sea air, bringing a distinct depth of flavour said to go very well with salted caramel. Oban 14 Year Old is a superb combination of rich sweetness and smoky dryness with fruity notes of oranges, pears and dried figs, plus hints of sea-salt and peat smoke notes. It works well as an accompaniment to seafood like oysters or smoked salmon, giving them new depths of flavour.",
