When the cough receptors scattered throughout your airways are stimulated by irritants or triggered by an accumulation of eccess mucus, they send a signal to the cough center in the brain to bring about a cough. Reduces Fever A fever is not an illness by itself but a symptom of something else that's making you sick, most likely like an infection. A fever is one of the ways your body responds to and battles an infection. As your body fights the infections, your body temperature may rise, resulting in a fever. Body Pain Body pain and headaches are common symptoms of many conditions including cold and flu. These viral infections attack your body to help white blood cells fight off infection. However, these same chemicals can cause the body to feel pain as a side effect. Headaches on the other hand may be caused by swelling in your sinuses or blood vessels in your head. Runny Nose & Sneezing Runny nose and sneezing usually occur when bacteria, allergens or virus attack and irritate your nose's lining. This may trigger a sneeze to get whatever is bothering the inside of your nose out. This may also trigger an inflammatory reaction causing mucus production to go into overdrive. This excess mucus is your body trying to get rid of these irritants and can result in a runny nose. Sore Throat When your throat is scratchy and even talking hurts, you just want relief. There are many causes of dore throats, but the most common is a viral infection, like a cold or the flu. Nasal & Sinus Congestion Your sinuses, the pairs of cavities in your skull that connect to your nasal passageways, are thinly lined with mucus membranes to keep the inside of your nose moist. Irritants like viruses can cause the mucus membranes to become inflamed, narrowing the passageways and resulting in the accumulation of thick mucus. This causes that uncomfortable feeling of congestion making it difficult to breathe through your nose. Headache Headaches can feel different for everyone and are a common symptom of the cold and flu. Headaches from the cold and flu can be caused by swelling in your sinuses or blood vessels in your head. When you have a viral infection, your body secretes prostaglandins that can also cause headaches. Sinus Pressure Irritants can cause inflammation of the mucus membranes lining your airways and swelling of the sinus lining, leading to space restriction and decreased drainage of the sinus. This causes excess mucus buildup, putting pressure on the underlying tissues in your face and leading to that uncomfortable feeling of sinus pressure.

- Antihistamine  A cough is a reflex that helps get rid of mucus and foreign particles in your airways. When the cough receptors scattered throughout your airways are stimulated by irritants or triggered by an accumulation of eccess mucus, they send a signal to the cough center in the brain to bring about a cough.  A fever is not an illness by itself but a symptom of something else that's making you sick, most likely like an infection. A fever is one of the ways your body responds to and battles an infection. As your body fights the infections, your body temperature may rise, resulting in a fever.  Body pain and headaches are common symptoms of many conditions including cold and flu. These viral infections attack your body to help white blood cells fight off infection. However, these same chemicals can cause the body to feel pain as a side effect. Headaches on the other hand may be caused by swelling in your sinuses or blood vessels in your head.  Runny nose and sneezing usually occur when bacteria, allergens or virus attack and irritate your nose's lining. This may trigger a sneeze to get whatever is bothering the inside of your nose out. This may also trigger an inflammatory reaction causing mucus production to go into overdrive. This excess mucus is your body trying to get rid of these irritants and can result in a runny nose.  When your throat is scratchy and even talking hurts, you just want relief. There are many causes of dore throats, but the most common is a viral infection, like a cold or the flu.  Your sinuses, the pairs of cavities in your skull that connect to your nasal passageways, are thinly lined with mucus membranes to keep the inside of your nose moist. Irritants like viruses can cause the mucus membranes to become inflamed, narrowing the passageways and resulting in the accumulation of thick mucus. This causes that uncomfortable feeling of congestion making it difficult to breathe through your nose.  Headaches can feel different for everyone and are a common symptom of the cold and flu. Headaches from the cold and flu can be caused by swelling in your sinuses or blood vessels in your head. When you have a viral infection, your body secretes prostaglandins that can also cause headaches.  Irritants can cause inflammation of the mucus membranes lining your airways and swelling of the sinus lining, leading to space restriction and decreased drainage of the sinus.

Safe and Clean Highly Effective  What Is Multi-Masking?
The multi-masking technique allows you to use a different mask on different sections of your skin, targeting any specific skin care concerns you may have. Before you start a multi-masking routine youâll want to evaluate your skin to determine what you need. If you have dry areas, reach for a hydrating mask. For congested pores look to a clay mask which can help minimize pores. For skin affected by pollution, look for a charcoal mask to remove impurities. Finally, for dull skin use an exfoliating mask that can help reveal a more radiant complexion.  5 Minute Masking
Apply thin layer on clean skin and leave for 5 minutes. In case of contact with eyes rinse them immediately.  Carefully Selected Ingredients

That is why we are sharing information based on what we know about COVID-19 and the use of ibuprofen today and the historical facts we have at hand. Currently, there is no scientific evidence that directly links the use of ibuprofen or NSAIDs with worsened outcomes in patients suffering from COVID-19 infection. If you have concerns about taking products containing Ibuprofen, please consult your healthcare provider. COMBINING MEDICATIONS Advil is committed to your safety. As with any OTC medicine, it is important to understand the potential for interactions with other medication. If you are taking ibuprofen with any other drugs, prescription or nonprescription, consult with your doctor. POTENTIAL HEALTH EFFECTS Ibuprofen has one of the lowest toxicity levels of all over-the-counter pain medications, limiting the risk of overdose situations. Due to its wide therapeutic margin and low toxicity profile, serious overdose situations or instances of death are rare. ADVIL AND PREGNANCY Can I take Advil if Iâm pregnant? Unless directed by a doctor, Advil should not be taken during pregnancy. Ibuprofen should not be used during the third trimester of pregnancy. Itâs especially important not to take ibuprofen, the main ingredient in Advil, during the last 3 months of pregnancy. Unless directed by a doctor, ibuprofen should not be consumed during this time. PRE-EXISTING HEALTH CONDITIONS When used as directed, itâs uncommon for Advil to cause adverse effects. If you have a history of stomach problems, high blood pressure, heart disease, liver cirrhosis, kidney disease, asthma, or had a stroke, make sure you consult with your doctor before taking Advil. Frequently Asked Questions   1. Question 1 What are health agencies saying about the safety of ibuprofen/Advil? GSK continues to monitor the rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation alongside public health authorities, including Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO), U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA), and medical experts. None of these agencies currently recommend that individuals should stop taking ibuprofen/Advil. 2. Question 2 Will taking ibuprofen/Advil mask the symptoms of coronavirus (COVID-19)? Ibuprofen, as well some other OTC analgesics may reduce fever due to their anti-pyretic properties. We advise you should speak directly with your doctor or healthcare provider if you have questions about your individual treatment needs. 3. Question 3 I recently read an article that said you shouldnât take ibuprofen/Advil if you have coronavirus (COVID-19), is this true? The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is currently not aware of scientific evidence establishing a link between NSAIDs (e.g., ibuprofen, naproxen) and worsening of COVID-19. We recommend you speak with your healthcare providers if you have any questions about the appropriate treatment for your unique individual needs when seeking to prevent or manage symptoms or conditions.   Click to Start Learn more Why Choose Advil? While there are many pain relievers available for sale without a prescription, it is important to know the differences between them. The pain reliever in AdvilÂ® (Ibuprofen) is part of a class of drugs called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) that also includes aspirin and naproxen sodium. Clinical studies have shown that when taken as directed, AdvilÂ® is a safe and effective pain reliever. When taking other medications, it is important to understand the ingredients to reduce the risk of drug interaction and adverse effects. AdvilÂ® is different than other OTC pain medications and does not contain acetaminophen, an active ingredient often found in many other pain relievers. AdvilÂ® is the #1 doctor recommended pain reliever for joint pain.3 For over 30 years, patients and doctors have trusted AdvilÂ® to deliver powerful relief from many kinds of acute pain: headache, muscle aches, minor arthritis and other joint pain, and backache. 3 Based on a monthly survey of doctor recommendations.

Antiperspirants act by plugging the sweat ducts, reducing wetness. Because perspiration stimulates odor-causing bacteria, antiperspirants also help reduce body odor. How do Secret antiperspirants help prevent underarm odor and wetness? Because perspiration in the underarms doesn't readily evaporate, a feeling of wetness results, and bacteria thrive in that wetness, creating underarm odor. Secret works by slowing the flow of perspiration to the surface of the skin. It does so by being pH (measure of alkalinity) balanced. When the active ingredient in Secret comes in contact with your perspiration, it dissolves into the sweat ducts. As you continue to perspire, the perspiration makes the pH of the solution rise. When the solution reaches a high enough pH, the active ingredient forms superficial plugs in those sweat ducts, reducing the flow of perspiration to keep you feeling dry. Secret protects you from underarm wetness (antiperspirant) and also helps prevent underarm odor (deodorant). Do SecretÂ® antiperspirants have an expiration date? Yes, Secret antiperspirants have an expiration date located either on the bottom of the container or on the bottom of the back label. Our research shows the ingredients are stable until the expiration date if stored according to instructions on the label. Beyond that date, the ingredients may no longer be stable and/or the product formulation may change. How do deodorants work? Unlike antiperspirants, deodorants donât reduce wetness; they help reduce the bacteria that thrive in perspiration and cause the odor. By doing this, deodorants cover up underarm odor. In addition, most deodorants are scented to also fight odor. What causes underarm wetness and odor? Perspiration is the body's natural way to regulate its temperature and hydrate the skin. Perspiration itself is essentially odorless and evaporates readily. In areas like underarms, where perspiration can't readily evaporate, it causes the feeling of wetness. Bacteria, which thrive in warm and moist surroundings, break down the perspiration and create underarm odor.

When the cough receptors scattered throughout your airways are stimulated by irritants or triggered by an accumulation of excess mucus, they send a signal to the cough center in the brain to bring about a cough. Headache Headaches can feel different for everyone. Headaches coupled with other flu symptoms are called a secondary headaches. Whatever illness youâre suffering from may be triggering the pain-sensitive nerves that are in and around your head. Nasal Congestion The underlying cause of your stuffy nose is typically irritated or inflamed nasal mucus membranes and surrounding tissue as well as enlarged blood vessels. That stuffed up feeling that comes with congestion is mostly caused by this swelling combined with the thick mucus that may be stuck in your narrowed nasal passages, making it difficult to breathe through the nose. Sinus Congestion Your sinuses, the pairs of cavities in your skull that connect to your nasal passageways, are thinly lined with mucus membranes to keep the inside of your nose moist. Irritants like viruses can cause the mucus membranes to become inflamed, resulting in space restriction and accumulation of mucus in the sinus. This causes that uncomfortable feeling of sinus congestion. Sinus Pressure Irritants can cause inflammation of the mucus membranes lining your airways and swelling of the sinus tissues, leading to space restriction and decreased drainage of the sinus. This causes excess mucus buildup, putting pressure on the underlying tissues in your face and leading to that uncomfortable feeling of sinus pressure. Fever A fever is not an illness by itself but a symptom of something else thatâs making you sick, most likely an infection.
