              - text: Twice the suction of any other cordless vacuum¹ Cord-free cleaning, made
                  easier, with twice the suction of any other cordless vacuum.¹
                  With fade-free battery power and a battery-saving trigger.
                  Monitors system performance and reports in real time on the
                  LCD screen to give you control of your clean. Features The
                  right cleaning mode for the right task Three cleaning modes
                  optimised for a variety of tasks. The right balance of power
                  and run time, where you need it. Powerful cleaning on floors
                  and carpets An integrated digital motor spins the brush bar up
                  to 60 times a second. It drives stiff nylon bristles deep into
                  carpet to remove dirt, while carbon fiber filaments capture
                  fine dust on hard floors. LCD Screen Displays cleaning modes
                  and lets you switch easily between Eco, Auto and Boost. Unique
                  battery power management system Dyson’s power-optimising
                  technology and battery-saving trigger help maximise run time,
                  only using power when you need it. ‘Point and shoot’ hygienic
                  bin emptying The ‘point and shoot’ mechanism hygienically
                  ejects dust and debris deep into your bin, in one action – so
                  there’s no need to touch the dirt. Drop-in docking The Dyson
                  V11™ vacuum drops into the wall-mounted dock, to charge it and
                  tidily store tools. So it’s ready to grab and go. Click-in
                  battery pack It's easy to remove and replace the click-in
                  battery at the press of a button. If you have a spare battery,
                  we recommend that you swap them out from time to time, so that
                  they both have time to naturally discharge. Learn more about
                  battery life and maintenance. Washable filter Washing your
                  Dyson filter is quick and easy and keeps your machine
                  performing at its best. Once washed, leave it for at least 24
                  hours in an area with good airflow, to ensure it's completely
                  dry before returning it to the machine. Learn more about how
                  to care for your filter. Technology Fade-free power The
                  seven-cell nickel-cobalt-aluminium battery has the fade-free
                  power to clean here, there and everywhere around your home.

                  power. Powered by a Dyson Hyperdymium™ motor Spins at up to
                  125,000rpm, creating more suction power than most corded
                  vacuums.¹ Radial Root Cyclone™ technology 14 cyclones generate
                  forces of 79,000g to fling dust into the bin without clogging
                  the filter, so there’s no loss of suction. Advanced
                  whole-machine filtration Dyson's fully-sealed, six-layer
                  filtration system is developed by the same engineers that make
                  Dyson machines. It's tested to trap 99.97% of particles as
                  small as 0.3 microns² – and expel cleaner air into your home.
                  Acoustically engineered Designed to absorb vibrations and
                  dampen noise, to keep sound levels down. In-line configuration
                  The motor, bin and cyclone are aligned, so air is drawn into
                  the cyclones in a straight line – helping to create powerful
                  Dyson suction. Are you an owner?
