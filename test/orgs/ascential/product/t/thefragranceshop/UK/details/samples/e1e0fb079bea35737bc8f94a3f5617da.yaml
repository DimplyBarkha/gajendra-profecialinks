                  For those with a more notable foray of facial hair, give it
                  the care it deserves with our nourishing Beard Oil. Formulated
                  with argan oil and olive oil, it helps to keep facial hair
                  soft, thick and strong, while Shea butter helps to keep your
                  skin soft and supple. Argan Oil Argan oil is most commonly
                  used as a skin moisturiser to hydrate and soften skin. With
                  its high Vitamin E and fatty acid content, argan oil is the
                  ideal product to give skin a natural boost. It absorbs easily
                  and is non-greasy and non-irritating, which makes it a great
                  natural moisturiser. Argan oil is proven to make hair softer,
                  silkier and shinier. It is the ideal hair conditioner, and it
                  can even help to treat split ends and tame frizzy hair. Due to
                  its ability to tame frizz and give hair shine, argan oil is
                  also commonly used as a styling agent. It makes hair more
                  manageable and adds a healthy, attractive shine to any hair
                  style. The vitamin E and fatty acids in argan oil are
                  excellent for repairing damaged skin and providing it with
                  nutrients which will prevent any dryness and irritation under
                  the beard on the skin. Shea Butter Shea butter is one of
                  nature's best ingredients for facial products. It has the
                  ability to penetrate into the deeper layers of your skin. This
                  prevents moisture loss and helps promote the delivery of other
                  active antioxidants. Also, because it's absorbed and doesn't
                  sit on the outer layer of your skin, shea won't leave your
                  skin greasy or clog your pores. Shea butter has a naturally
                  high content of antioxidants and phytosterols that literally
                  help to nourish and feed your skin. Vitamins A and E are both
                  antioxidants that fight free radicals by preventing the
                  cellular rusting that's caused by environmental factors.
                  Vitamin A can also help to reduce wrinkles and boost collagen
                  production.
                    
                  REPAIR AND PROTECT Our ingredient Argan Oil serves to penetrate the hair and repair damaged follicles without being greasy. This will leave the beard healthy, feeling great and growing as it should.

                  SOFTEN AND SHINE Our beard oil will help your beard shine and keep it soft while preventing premature ‘greying’ hairs and circulate blood flow to keep your beard growing. With Vitamin E Oil and Argan Oil, your beard will be conditioned and cleansed to shine, feel soft and smell great too!
                   

                  How to UseDrop the desired amount of oil into your palms and work the oil through your facial hair and into your skin.
                    Finish by brushing a comb through your beard to ensure an even application.
