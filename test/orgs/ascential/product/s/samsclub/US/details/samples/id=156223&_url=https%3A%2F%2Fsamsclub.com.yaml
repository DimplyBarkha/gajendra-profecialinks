                  What Is Spring Water?
                   
                  Spring water is a natural water option. Specifically, this water comes from a natural underground source that rises to the surface. Water must reach the surface naturally in order to qualify as mountain spring water, but when it is bottled, it's collected at the source to ensure freshness and purity. This water is not filtered or processed like purified or distilled water products.
