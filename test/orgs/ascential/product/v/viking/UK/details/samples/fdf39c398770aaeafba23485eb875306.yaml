                  hand towels are not only extremely durable but the strong 1
                  ply keeps rips and tears to a minimum The crisp white colour
                  adapts perfectly to any environment that it’s placed in.
                  Niceday Professional brings you reliable hygiene accessories
                  at a price that won’t break the bank. Time to say goodbye to

                  towels will serve their duty on more than one front. Niceday
                  Professional cares about the environment! The Niceday
                  Professional range is upgraded to comply with the most
                  demanding certification schemes, used on products to
                  demonstrate that timber-based products are from sustainable
                  sources. The Rainforest Alliance is one of the founding
                  members of the Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC®), the largest
                  sustainable forestry standard setter in the world. For our
                  Niceday Professional tissue range, our raw-material comes from
                  planted forests, mainly from the Iberian Peninsula. The
                  eucalyptus globulus trees used for the range provides up to
                  68% more pulp (compared to pine) allowing the same amount of
                  paper to be produced using less wood with the added benefit of
                  a better smoothness, resistance and absorption. Niceday
                  Professional tissue also respects the criteria for EU Ecolabel
                  certification. These strict environmental criteria, set by a
                  panel of experts as well as representatives of consumer
                  organizations, take the whole product life cycle into account,
                  including low air and water pollution during paper production,
                  reduced environmental impact or risks related to the use of
                  hazardous chemicals, and increased recyclability.
