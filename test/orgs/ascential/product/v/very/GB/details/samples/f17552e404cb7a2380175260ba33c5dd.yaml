                  More suction power than most corded vacuums¹

                  Up to 60 minutes of powerful floor cleaning²

                  Quickly converts from a floor vacuum to a handheld vacuum. For easy cleaning around the home and car.

                  Four cleaning tools included

                  Combination and Crevice tool to clean surfaces, edges and right into narrow gaps.

                  Mini motorhead to tackle pet hair on upholstery, stairs and in the car.

                  Soft dusting brush for gentle dusting on delicate surfaces.

                  A big bin for the big cleans

                  Less stopping to empty the bin so you can clean more of your home in one go.
