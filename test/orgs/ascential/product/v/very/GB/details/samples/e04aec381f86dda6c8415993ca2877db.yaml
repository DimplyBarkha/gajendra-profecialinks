                  Epicyclic Drive technology cleans deep into carpets and seals
                  in suction on hard floors. With Articulated wand handle for
                  effortless whole-home cleaning.

                  The Dyson Ball Animal 2 upright vacuum cleaner is engineered for deep cleaning and homes with pets – no other vacuum cleans better across carpets and hard floors¹.

                  Epicyclic Drive technology cleans deep into carpets and seals in suction on hard floors to remove remove microscopic dust, dander and stubborn dirt.

                  Radial Root Cyclone™ technology delivers powerful suction to capture even microscopic allergens in the bin, while variable suction control offers three modes to tackle different tasks.

                  For effortless whole-home cleaning, the articulated wand handle pivots and rotates 360°, enabling more control when cleaning hard-to-reach places from floor to ceiling.

                  It comes with a variety of quick-release tools – including the Tangle-free turbine tool for removing pet hair from upholstery, and the additional Carbon fibre floor tool with a slim profile for cleaning under low furniture.

                  To clean big homes with fewer interruptions, it has a larger bin and longer hose and cord, while Ball™ technology steers easily around furniture and obstacles.
