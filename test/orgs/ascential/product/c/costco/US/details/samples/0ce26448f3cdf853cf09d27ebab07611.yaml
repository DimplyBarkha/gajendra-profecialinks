                   When it comes to reducing fever or relieving pain, TYLENOL® is the brand recommended most by pediatricians.1 Infants’ TYLENOL® works differently than other pain and fever medicines. It also won’t upset little stomachs. If your child is under 2 years of age, be sure to ask your doctor.

                  Five Symptoms to Watch For
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   Watch out for these symptoms in addition to fevers as they may be signs of a serious – and possibly dangerous – illness. Keep an eye out for the following five symptoms, which could indicate a problem when coupled with a fever. 

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   
                  LETHARGY
                   
                   Your child has lost his appetite, has little energy, or is noticeably pale or flushed, or you notice other changes in his behavior and appearance. 

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   
                  RASH
                   
                   Your child has small, purple-red spots on his skin that don't turn white when you press on them, or large purple blotches. 

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   
                  DIFFICULTY SWALLOWING
                   
                   Your child is unable to swallow and is drooling excessively. 

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   
                  DIFFICULTY BREATHING
                   
                   Your child has difficulty breathing even after you clear his nose with a bulb syringe. 

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   
                  MOOD
                   
                   Your child seems delirious, glass-eyed, or extremely cranky or irritable. 

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   
                  If you notice any of these symptoms with a fever, call your pediatrician right away.
                   

                   

                   
                  In general, it's a good idea to check with your pediatrician if you feel uncomfortable about your child's appearance or behavior, no matter the temperature of your child. Trust your gut.
                   

                   

                   
                  Remember, too, that fever is only one sign of illness. Be sure to mention symptoms such as a cough and ear pain (if you suspect it) or vomiting and diarrhea – these can help your pediatrician make a more accurate diagnosis.
                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   
                  How to Measure a Fever
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   Before you can treat a fever, it is important to accurately measure your child’s temperature. Here are a few easy techniques to get you started. 
                  When a child is sick, the first thing the doctor’s office may ask is, “What’s her temperature and how did you take it?” There are a variety of thermometers and ways to take a child’s temperature, so it’s helpful to know what’s recommended for each age.
                   
                  Basic digital thermometers are a good choice. They are accurate, fast, easy to use, inexpensive, and can be used for a variety of temperature-taking methods: in the bottom (rectal), by mouth (oral), or under the arm. NOTE: A thermometer used for taking temperatures should not be used for other methods.

                  Babies under age 3 months
                   

                   
                  The rectal method is the most reliable for young infants. If your baby is under 3 months of age and has a temperature of 100.4°F or higher, contact your doctor right away. Babies this young need to be checked for infection or disease.
                   

                   
                  To take a rectal temperature: 
                   
                  Wash the thermometer, then rinse with cool water.
                   

                   

                   
                  Coat the tip with petroleum jelly.
                   

                   

                   
                  Place your child either on his back with knees bent or on his belly.
                   

                   

                   
                  Holding your child still, insert the thermometer ½ to 1 inch into the bottom.
                   

                   

                   
                  Hold until it beeps, then remove for reading.
                   

                   
                  Children under age 4 years
                   

                   
                  Active, older children may not cooperate well with the rectal method. Another option is the underarm method, but it is less accurate. An underarm reading can be as much as 2 degrees lower than an internal rectal reading.
                   

                   
                  To take an underarm temperature:
                   

                   
                  Remove your child’s shirt.
                   

                   

                   
                  Make sure the underarm is dry.
                   

                   

                   
                  Press the thermometer tip against the armpit.
                   

                   

                   
                  Keep your child’s arm firmly against her side.
                   

                   

                   
                  Hold until it beeps, then remove for reading.
                   

                   
                  Children ages 4 & up
                   

                   
                  For older kids, a temperature taken by mouth is accurate when taken properly (your child must be able to hold the thermometer in place long enough to get a reading).
                   

                   
                  To take an oral temperature:
                   

                   
                  Wash the thermometer, then rinse with cool water.
                   

                   

                   
                  Put the tip under your child’s tongue, near the back of the mouth.
                   

                   

                   
                  Hold in place until it beeps, then remove for reading.
                   

                   
                  If you have questions or concerns, talk to your doctor. 

                  Other ways to take your child’s temperature
                   

                   
                  Ear thermometers are quick and comfortable, but can be tricky to use.
                   

                   

                   
                  Temporal artery thermometers are swiped across the forehead (they may be reliable, but are more expensive).
                   

                   

                   
                  Fever strips and pacifier thermometers are not recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
                   

                   
                  Fevers could be a sign that your child's body is fighting off an infection. Most fevers are caused by common childhood illnesses like colds, flu, ear infections, bronchitis, and tonsillitis. Usually, a fever is just a symptom of an infection or other condition. In most cases, a fever will go away on its own in 2 or 3 days.
                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   
                  When to Call the Doctor
                   

                   

                   

                   
                  Here's how to know if it's time:
                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   
                  If your little one is feeling ill and you’re not completely sure what to do, don’t be afraid to pick up the phone. Sometimes it helps to get a second opinion to reassure your knowledge and instincts as a parent.
                   
                  Here’s how to know if it’s time to call your child’s doctor:
                   
                  Child is UNDER 3 months (12 weeks):
                   

                   
                  Has a temperature of 100.4°F or higher.
                   

                   

                   
                  Keep in mind that you know your child best. Always follow your instinct and call the doctor if you feel something is wrong.
                   

                   
                  Child is OVER 3 months (12 weeks):
                   

                   
                  Has a temperature of 104°F or higher OR
                   

                   

                   
                  Has a temperature of 100.4°F or higher PLUS any of these symptoms:
                   
                   
                   - Severe headache.
                   - Repeated vomiting or diarrhea.
                   - Strange rash.
                   - Sore throat or ear pain.
                   - Stiff neck.
                   - Looks very ill or is extremely drowsy/fussy.
                   - Has been in a very hot place (such as an overheated car).
                   - Has underlying immune system problems, seizure history, or takes steroids.

                   
                  Child has ANY of the following:
                   

                   
                  Seems to be getting worse, even with comfort measures.
                   

                   

                   
                  Is between 3 and 24 months and still has a fever (100.4°F or higher) after 24 hours.
                   

                   

                   
                  Is 24 months or older and still has a fever (100.4°F or higher) after 3 days or still “acts sick” when the fever goes away.
                   

                   
                  If you do call your child’s doctor, make sure to let them know which type (Infants', Children's, etc.) and strength of medicine you're giving to your child, if any. Also inform them if your child has any underlying risk factors that could cause further complications.

                  Some tips for soothing sore gums
                   
                   Pressure works 

                   
                  Gently rub your baby’s gums with a clean finger or offer a teething ring/pacifier made of firm rubber.
                   

                   
                  Keep things cool
                   

                   
                  Chill a teething ring, pacifier or wet washcloth – but don’t fully freeze it. Anything too hard can damage your child’s delicate gums. You can also give your child cool, soft foods like applesauce or yogurt if he/she is eating solids.
                   

                   
                  What to avoid
                   

                   
                  Avoid rub-on teething gels or liquids for babies less than 2 years old. Many contain benzocaine, an ingredient that can cause dangerous side effects in young babies. Stay away from liquid-filled teething rings, as they may burst. Last, never tie a teething ring around your baby’s neck for easy access.
                   

                   
                  Keep your baby comfortable

                  Five Symptoms to Watch For
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   Watch out for these symptoms in addition to fevers as they may be signs of a serious – and possibly dangerous – illness. Keep an eye out for the following five symptoms, which could indicate a problem when coupled with a fever. 

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   
                  LETHARGY
                   
                   Your child has lost his appetite, has little energy, or is noticeably pale or flushed, or you notice other changes in his behavior and appearance. 

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   
                  RASH
                   
                   Your child has small, purple-red spots on his skin that don't turn white when you press on them, or large purple blotches. 

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   
                  DIFFICULTY SWALLOWING
                   
                   Your child is unable to swallow and is drooling excessively. 

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   
                  DIFFICULTY BREATHING
                   
                   Your child has difficulty breathing even after you clear his nose with a bulb syringe. 

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   
                  MOOD
                   
                   Your child seems delirious, glass-eyed, or extremely cranky or irritable. 

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   
                  If you notice any of these symptoms with a fever, call your pediatrician right away.
                   

                   

                   
                  In general, it's a good idea to check with your pediatrician if you feel uncomfortable about your child's appearance or behavior, no matter the temperature of your child. Trust your gut.
                   

                   

                   
                  Remember, too, that fever is only one sign of illness. Be sure to mention symptoms such as a cough and ear pain (if you suspect it) or vomiting and diarrhea – these can help your pediatrician make a more accurate diagnosis.
                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   
                  How to Measure a Fever
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   Before you can treat a fever, it is important to accurately measure your child’s temperature. Here are a few easy techniques to get you started. 
                  When a child is sick, the first thing the doctor’s office may ask is, “What’s her temperature and how did you take it?” There are a variety of thermometers and ways to take a child’s temperature, so it’s helpful to know what’s recommended for each age.
                   
                  Basic digital thermometers are a good choice. They are accurate, fast, easy to use, inexpensive, and can be used for a variety of temperature-taking methods: in the bottom (rectal), by mouth (oral), or under the arm. NOTE: A thermometer used for taking temperatures should not be used for other methods.

                  Babies under age 3 months
                   

                   
                  The rectal method is the most reliable for young infants. If your baby is under 3 months of age and has a temperature of 100.4°F or higher, contact your doctor right away. Babies this young need to be checked for infection or disease.
                   

                   
                  To take a rectal temperature: 
                   
                  Wash the thermometer, then rinse with cool water.
                   

                   

                   
                  Coat the tip with petroleum jelly.
                   

                   

                   
                  Place your child either on his back with knees bent or on his belly.
                   

                   

                   
                  Holding your child still, insert the thermometer ½ to 1 inch into the bottom.
                   

                   

                   
                  Hold until it beeps, then remove for reading.
                   

                   
                  Children under age 4 years
                   

                   
                  Active, older children may not cooperate well with the rectal method. Another option is the underarm method, but it is less accurate. An underarm reading can be as much as 2 degrees lower than an internal rectal reading.
                   

                   
                  To take an underarm temperature:
                   

                   
                  Remove your child’s shirt.
                   

                   

                   
                  Make sure the underarm is dry.
                   

                   

                   
                  Press the thermometer tip against the armpit.
                   

                   

                   
                  Keep your child’s arm firmly against her side.
                   

                   

                   
                  Hold until it beeps, then remove for reading.
                   

                   
                  Children ages 4 & up
                   

                   
                  For older kids, a temperature taken by mouth is accurate when taken properly (your child must be able to hold the thermometer in place long enough to get a reading).
                   

                   
                  To take an oral temperature:
                   

                   
                  Wash the thermometer, then rinse with cool water.
                   

                   

                   
                  Put the tip under your child’s tongue, near the back of the mouth.
                   

                   

                   
                  Hold in place until it beeps, then remove for reading.

                  Fevers could be a sign that your child's body is fighting off an infection. Most fevers are caused by common childhood illnesses like colds, flu, ear infections, bronchitis, and tonsillitis. Usually, a fever is just a symptom of an infection or other condition. In most cases, a fever will go away on its own in 2 or 3 days.

                  How to Measure a Fever
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   
                   Before you can treat a fever, it is important to accurately measure your child’s temperature. Here are a few easy techniques to get you started. 
                  When a child is sick, the first thing the doctor’s office may ask is, “What’s her temperature and how did you take it?” There are a variety of thermometers and ways to take a child’s temperature, so it’s helpful to know what’s recommended for each age.
                   
                  Basic digital thermometers are a good choice. They are accurate, fast, easy to use, inexpensive, and can be used for a variety of temperature-taking methods: in the bottom (rectal), by mouth (oral), or under the arm. NOTE: A thermometer used for taking temperatures should not be used for other methods.

                  Babies under age 3 months
                   

                   
                  The rectal method is the most reliable for young infants. If your baby is under 3 months of age and has a temperature of 100.4°F or higher, contact your doctor right away. Babies this young need to be checked for infection or disease.
                   

                   
                  To take a rectal temperature: 
                   
                  Wash the thermometer, then rinse with cool water.
                   

                   

                   
                  Coat the tip with petroleum jelly.
                   

                   

                   
                  Place your child either on his back with knees bent or on his belly.
                   

                   

                   
                  Holding your child still, insert the thermometer ½ to 1 inch into the bottom.
                   

                   

                   
                  Hold until it beeps, then remove for reading.
                   

                   
                  Children under age 4 years
                   

                   
                  Active, older children may not cooperate well with the rectal method. Another option is the underarm method, but it is less accurate. An underarm reading can be as much as 2 degrees lower than an internal rectal reading.
                   

                   
                  To take an underarm temperature:
                   

                   
                  Remove your child’s shirt.
                   

                   

                   
                  Make sure the underarm is dry.
                   

                   

                   
                  Press the thermometer tip against the armpit.
                   

                   

                   
                  Keep your child’s arm firmly against her side.
                   

                   

                   
                  Hold until it beeps, then remove for reading.
                   

                   
                  Children ages 4 & up
                   

                   
                  For older kids, a temperature taken by mouth is accurate when taken properly (your child must be able to hold the thermometer in place long enough to get a reading).
                   

                   
                  To take an oral temperature:
                   

                   
                  Wash the thermometer, then rinse with cool water.
                   

                   

                   
                  Put the tip under your child’s tongue, near the back of the mouth.
                   

                   

                   
                  Hold in place until it beeps, then remove for reading.
                   

                   
                  If you have questions or concerns, talk to your doctor.

                  Before you can treat a fever, it is important to accurately
                  measure your child’s temperature. Here are a few easy
                  techniques to get you started. 

                  When a child is sick, the first thing the doctor’s office may ask is, “What’s her temperature and how did you take it?” There are a variety of thermometers and ways to take a child’s temperature, so it’s helpful to know what’s recommended for each age.
                   
                  Basic digital thermometers are a good choice. They are accurate, fast, easy to use, inexpensive, and can be used for a variety of temperature-taking methods: in the bottom (rectal), by mouth (oral), or under the arm. NOTE: A thermometer used for taking temperatures should not be used for other methods.

                  Babies under age 3 months
                   

                   
                  The rectal method is the most reliable for young infants. If your baby is under 3 months of age and has a temperature of 100.4°F or higher, contact your doctor right away. Babies this young need to be checked for infection or disease.
                   

                   
                  To take a rectal temperature: 
                   
                  Wash the thermometer, then rinse with cool water.
                   

                   

                   
                  Coat the tip with petroleum jelly.
                   

                   

                   
                  Place your child either on his back with knees bent or on his belly.
                   

                   

                   
                  Holding your child still, insert the thermometer ½ to 1 inch into the bottom.
                   

                   

                   
                  Hold until it beeps, then remove for reading.
                   

                   
                  Children under age 4 years
                   

                   
                  Active, older children may not cooperate well with the rectal method. Another option is the underarm method, but it is less accurate. An underarm reading can be as much as 2 degrees lower than an internal rectal reading.
                   

                   
                  To take an underarm temperature:
                   

                   
                  Remove your child’s shirt.
                   

                   

                   
                  Make sure the underarm is dry.
                   

                   

                   
                  Press the thermometer tip against the armpit.
                   

                   

                   
                  Keep your child’s arm firmly against her side.
                   

                   

                   
                  Hold until it beeps, then remove for reading.
                   

                   
                  Children ages 4 & up
                   

                   
                  For older kids, a temperature taken by mouth is accurate when taken properly (your child must be able to hold the thermometer in place long enough to get a reading).
                   

                   
                  To take an oral temperature:
                   

                   
                  Wash the thermometer, then rinse with cool water.
                   

                   

                   
                  Put the tip under your child’s tongue, near the back of the mouth.
                   

                   

                   
                  Hold in place until it beeps, then remove for reading.
                   

                   
                  If you have questions or concerns, talk to your doctor. 

                  Other ways to take your child’s temperature
                   

                   
                  Ear thermometers are quick and comfortable, but can be tricky to use.
                   

                   

                   
                  Temporal artery thermometers are swiped across the forehead (they may be reliable, but are more expensive).
                   

                   

                   
                  Fever strips and pacifier thermometers are not recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics.
                   

                   
                  Fevers could be a sign that your child's body is fighting off an infection. Most fevers are caused by common childhood illnesses like colds, flu, ear infections, bronchitis, and tonsillitis. Usually, a fever is just a symptom of an infection or other condition. In most cases, a fever will go away on its own in 2 or 3 days.

                  Fevers could be a sign that your child's body is fighting off an infection. Most fevers are caused by common childhood illnesses like colds, flu, ear infections, bronchitis, and tonsillitis. Usually, a fever is just a symptom of an infection or other condition. In most cases, a fever will go away on its own in 2 or 3 days.

                  Before you can treat a fever, it is important to accurately
                  measure your child’s temperature. Here are a few easy
                  techniques to get you started. 

                  When a child is sick, the first thing the doctor’s office may ask is, “What’s her temperature and how did you take it?” There are a variety of thermometers and ways to take a child’s temperature, so it’s helpful to know what’s recommended for each age.
                   
                  Basic digital thermometers are a good choice. They are accurate, fast, easy to use, inexpensive, and can be used for a variety of temperature-taking methods: in the bottom (rectal), by mouth (oral), or under the arm. NOTE: A thermometer used for taking temperatures should not be used for other methods.

                  Babies under age 3 months
                   

                   
                  The rectal method is the most reliable for young infants. If your baby is under 3 months of age and has a temperature of 100.4°F or higher, contact your doctor right away. Babies this young need to be checked for infection or disease.
                   

                   
                  To take a rectal temperature: 
                   
                  Wash the thermometer, then rinse with cool water.
                   

                   

                   
                  Coat the tip with petroleum jelly.
                   

                   

                   
                  Place your child either on his back with knees bent or on his belly.
                   

                   

                   
                  Holding your child still, insert the thermometer ½ to 1 inch into the bottom.
                   

                   

                   
                  Hold until it beeps, then remove for reading.
                   

                   
                  Children under age 4 years
                   

                   
                  Active, older children may not cooperate well with the rectal method. Another option is the underarm method, but it is less accurate. An underarm reading can be as much as 2 degrees lower than an internal rectal reading.
                   

                   
                  To take an underarm temperature:
                   

                   
                  Remove your child’s shirt.
                   

                   

                   
                  Make sure the underarm is dry.
                   

                   

                   
                  Press the thermometer tip against the armpit.
                   

                   

                   
                  Keep your child’s arm firmly against her side.
                   

                   

                   
                  Hold until it beeps, then remove for reading.
                   

                   
                  Children ages 4 & up
                   

                   
                  For older kids, a temperature taken by mouth is accurate when taken properly (your child must be able to hold the thermometer in place long enough to get a reading).
                   

                   
                  To take an oral temperature:
                   

                   
                  Wash the thermometer, then rinse with cool water.
                   

                   

                   
                  Put the tip under your child’s tongue, near the back of the mouth.
                   

                   

                   
                  Hold in place until it beeps, then remove for reading.
                   

                   
                  If you have questions or concerns, talk to your doctor.

                  Here's how to know if it's time:
                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   
                  If your little one is feeling ill and you’re not completely sure what to do, don’t be afraid to pick up the phone. Sometimes it helps to get a second opinion to reassure your knowledge and instincts as a parent.
                   
                  Here’s how to know if it’s time to call your child’s doctor:
                   
                  Child is UNDER 3 months (12 weeks):
                   

                   
                  Has a temperature of 100.4°F or higher.
                   

                   

                   
                  Keep in mind that you know your child best. Always follow your instinct and call the doctor if you feel something is wrong.
                   

                   
                  Child is OVER 3 months (12 weeks):
                   

                   
                  Has a temperature of 104°F or higher OR
                   

                   

                   
                  Has a temperature of 100.4°F or higher PLUS any of these symptoms:
                   
                   
                   - Severe headache.
                   - Repeated vomiting or diarrhea.
                   - Strange rash.
                   - Sore throat or ear pain.
                   - Stiff neck.
                   - Looks very ill or is extremely drowsy/fussy.
                   - Has been in a very hot place (such as an overheated car).
                   - Has underlying immune system problems, seizure history, or takes steroids.

                   
                  Child has ANY of the following:
                   

                   
                  Seems to be getting worse, even with comfort measures.
                   

                   

                   
                  Is between 3 and 24 months and still has a fever (100.4°F or higher) after 24 hours.
                   

                   

                   
                  Is 24 months or older and still has a fever (100.4°F or higher) after 3 days or still “acts sick” when the fever goes away.
                   

                   
                  If you do call your child’s doctor, make sure to let them know which type (Infants', Children's, etc.) and strength of medicine you're giving to your child, if any. Also inform them if your child has any underlying risk factors that could cause further complications.

                  Some tips for soothing sore gums
                   
                   Pressure works 

                   
                  Gently rub your baby’s gums with a clean finger or offer a teething ring/pacifier made of firm rubber.
                   

                   
                  Keep things cool
                   

                   
                  Chill a teething ring, pacifier or wet washcloth – but don’t fully freeze it. Anything too hard can damage your child’s delicate gums. You can also give your child cool, soft foods like applesauce or yogurt if he/she is eating solids.
                   

                   
                  What to avoid
                   

                   
                  Avoid rub-on teething gels or liquids for babies less than 2 years old. Many contain benzocaine, an ingredient that can cause dangerous side effects in young babies. Stay away from liquid-filled teething rings, as they may burst. Last, never tie a teething ring around your baby’s neck for easy access.
                   

                   
                  Keep your baby comfortable

                  If your little one is feeling ill and you’re not completely
                  sure what to do, don’t be afraid to pick up the phone.
                  Sometimes it helps to get a second opinion to reassure your
                  knowledge and instincts as a parent.
                   
                  Here’s how to know if it’s time to call your child’s doctor:
                   
                  Child is UNDER 3 months (12 weeks):
                   

                   
                  Has a temperature of 100.4°F or higher.
                   

                   

                   
                  Keep in mind that you know your child best. Always follow your instinct and call the doctor if you feel something is wrong.
                   

                   
                  Child is OVER 3 months (12 weeks):
                   

                   
                  Has a temperature of 104°F or higher OR
                   

                   

                   
                  Has a temperature of 100.4°F or higher PLUS any of these symptoms:
                   
                   
                   - Severe headache.
                   - Repeated vomiting or diarrhea.
                   - Strange rash.
                   - Sore throat or ear pain.
                   - Stiff neck.
                   - Looks very ill or is extremely drowsy/fussy.
                   - Has been in a very hot place (such as an overheated car).
                   - Has underlying immune system problems, seizure history, or takes steroids.

                   
                  Child has ANY of the following:
                   

                   
                  Seems to be getting worse, even with comfort measures.
                   

                   

                   
                  Is between 3 and 24 months and still has a fever (100.4°F or higher) after 24 hours.
                   

                   

                   
                  Is 24 months or older and still has a fever (100.4°F or higher) after 3 days or still “acts sick” when the fever goes away.
                   

                   
                  If you do call your child’s doctor, make sure to let them know which type (Infants', Children's, etc.) and strength of medicine you're giving to your child, if any. Also inform them if your child has any underlying risk factors that could cause further complications.

                   It's normal. Teeth are pushing through the gums, after all.

                   Be careful - old wives' tales say that rubbing liquor on gums can numb them, but it can be harmful. 

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   
                  Experiencing a Slight Teething Fever
                   
                   A low-grade fever with teething is common, but a high fever over 101°F and diarrhea are not.2 

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   

                   
                  Some tips for soothing sore gums
                   
                   Pressure works 

                   
                  Gently rub your baby’s gums with a clean finger or offer a teething ring/pacifier made of firm rubber.
                   

                   
                  Keep things cool
                   

                   
                  Chill a teething ring, pacifier or wet washcloth – but don’t fully freeze it. Anything too hard can damage your child’s delicate gums. You can also give your child cool, soft foods like applesauce or yogurt if he/she is eating solids.
                   

                   
                  What to avoid
                   

                   
                  Avoid rub-on teething gels or liquids for babies less than 2 years old. Many contain benzocaine, an ingredient that can cause dangerous side effects in young babies. Stay away from liquid-filled teething rings, as they may burst. Last, never tie a teething ring around your baby’s neck for easy access.
                   

                   
                  Keep your baby comfortable
                   

                   
                  Try a pain medicine containing acetaminophen – such as Infants’ TYLENOL® – to ease pain from teething and fever if your baby is uncomfortable.
                   

                   
                  If you have any questions, talk to your pediatrician.

                  If your little one is feeling ill and you’re not completely
                  sure what to do, don’t be afraid to pick up the phone.
                  Sometimes it helps to get a second opinion to reassure your
                  knowledge and instincts as a parent.
                   
                  Here’s how to know if it’s time to call your child’s doctor:
                   
                  Child is UNDER 3 months (12 weeks):
                   

                   
                  Has a temperature of 100.4°F or higher.

                   It's normal. Teeth are pushing through the gums, after all.

                  Some tips for soothing sore gums
                   
                   Pressure works 

                   
                  Gently rub your baby’s gums with a clean finger or offer a teething ring/pacifier made of firm rubber.
                   

                   
                  Keep things cool
                   

                   
                  Chill a teething ring, pacifier or wet washcloth – but don’t fully freeze it. Anything too hard can damage your child’s delicate gums. You can also give your child cool, soft foods like applesauce or yogurt if he/she is eating solids.
                   

                   
                  What to avoid
                   

                   
                  Avoid rub-on teething gels or liquids for babies less than 2 years old. Many contain benzocaine, an ingredient that can cause dangerous side effects in young babies. Stay away from liquid-filled teething rings, as they may burst. Last, never tie a teething ring around your baby’s neck for easy access.
                   

                   
                  Keep your baby comfortable
                   

                   
                  Try a pain medicine containing acetaminophen – such as Infants’ TYLENOL® – to ease pain from teething and fever if your baby is uncomfortable.
                   

                   
                  If you have any questions, talk to your pediatrician.

                  Gently rub your baby’s gums with a clean finger or offer a teething ring/pacifier made of firm rubber.
                   

                   
                  Keep things cool
                   

                   
                  Chill a teething ring, pacifier or wet washcloth – but don’t fully freeze it. Anything too hard can damage your child’s delicate gums. You can also give your child cool, soft foods like applesauce or yogurt if he/she is eating solids.
                   

                   
                  What to avoid
                   

                   
                  Avoid rub-on teething gels or liquids for babies less than 2 years old. Many contain benzocaine, an ingredient that can cause dangerous side effects in young babies. Stay away from liquid-filled teething rings, as they may burst. Last, never tie a teething ring around your baby’s neck for easy access.
                   

                   
                  Keep your baby comfortable
                   

                   
                  Try a pain medicine containing acetaminophen – such as Infants’ TYLENOL® – to ease pain from teething and fever if your baby is uncomfortable.
