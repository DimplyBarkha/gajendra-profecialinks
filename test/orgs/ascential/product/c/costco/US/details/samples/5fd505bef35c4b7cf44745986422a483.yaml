                   Antioxidants 

                   
                  Vitamin C is essential in maintaining a healthy immune system, and is critical to the formation of collagen, a structural protein that supports the skin and internal organs.†
                   
                  Zinc is crucial to the immune system. It helps maintain white blood cell activity, and helps support antioxidant protection.†
                   

                   
                  B Vitamins
                   

                   
                  Thiamin (B1) plays a key role in the body's metabolic cycle for generating energy; helps in the metabolism of carbohydrates; and helps maintain a healthy nervous system.†
                   
                  Riboflavin (B2) is critical in breaking down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats so your body can use them for energy and repair.†
                   
                  Niacin (B3) is a component of coenzymes that are involved in producing energy and building larger molecules such as fatty acids and some hormones.†
                   
                  Vitamin B6 plays a role in forming energy-rich compounds and niacin, red blood cell and fat metabolism, nervous system functions, and modulation of hormones. Vitamin B6 is a dietarily important nutrient because the body cannot make it.†
                   
                  Folic Acid (B9) produces healthy effects in the body and cells by functioning with enzymes. Folic acid works with two other B vitamins, B12 & B6, to help maintain healthy levels of homocysteine, an amino acid, in the blood.†
                   
                  Vitamin B12 is used in helping metabolize food for energy and making healthy red blood cells. Healthy red blood cells help carry oxygen to cells.†
                   
                  Pantothenic Acid (B5) is an essential nutrient. A form of pantothenic acid is used in the body to help generate energy from fat, carbohydrates, and proteins.†
                   

                   
                  Electrolytes and Energy Metabolism Minerals
                   

                   
                  Calcium supports healthy fluid and electrolyte balance, muscle function, and also plays a critical role in the electrical conduction system of the heart.†
                   
                  Magnesium supports healthy fluid and electrolyte balance and muscle function. Over three hundred enzymes require magnesium as a cofactor.†
                   
                  Sodium supports healthy fluid and electrolyte balance, nerve and muscle function, and blood pH.†
                   
                  Potassium supports healthy fluid and electrolyte balance and is especially important for normal muscle contraction.†
                   
                  Phosphorus is an essential element used in the body as a structural component and participates in energy production and storage.†

                  Antioxidants 
                   
                  Vitamin C is essential in maintaining a healthy immune system, and is critical to the formation of collagen, a structural protein that supports the skin and internal organs.†
                   
                  Zinc is crucial to the immune system. It helps maintain white blood cell activity, and helps support antioxidant protection.†
                   

                   
                  B Vitamins
                   

                   
                  Thiamin (B1) plays a key role in the body's metabolic cycle for generating energy; helps in the metabolism of carbohydrates; and helps maintain a healthy nervous system.†
                   
                  Riboflavin (B2) is critical in breaking down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats so your body can use them for energy and repair.†
                   
                  Niacin (B3) is a component of coenzymes that are involved in producing energy and building larger molecules such as fatty acids and some hormones.†
                   
                  Vitamin B6 plays a role in forming energy-rich compounds and niacin, red blood cell and fat metabolism, nervous system functions, and modulation of hormones. Vitamin B6 is a dietarily important nutrient because the body cannot make it.†
                   
                  Folic Acid (B9) produces healthy effects in the body and cells by functioning with enzymes. Folic acid works with two other B vitamins, B12 & B6, to help maintain healthy levels of homocysteine, an amino acid, in the blood.†
                   
                  Vitamin B12 is used in helping metabolize food for energy and making healthy red blood cells. Healthy red blood cells help carry oxygen to cells.†
                   
                  Pantothenic Acid (B5) is an essential nutrient. A form of pantothenic acid is used in the body to help generate energy from fat, carbohydrates, and proteins.†
                   

                   
                  Electrolytes and Energy Metabolism Minerals
                   

                   
                  Calcium supports healthy fluid and electrolyte balance, muscle function, and also plays a critical role in the electrical conduction system of the heart.†
