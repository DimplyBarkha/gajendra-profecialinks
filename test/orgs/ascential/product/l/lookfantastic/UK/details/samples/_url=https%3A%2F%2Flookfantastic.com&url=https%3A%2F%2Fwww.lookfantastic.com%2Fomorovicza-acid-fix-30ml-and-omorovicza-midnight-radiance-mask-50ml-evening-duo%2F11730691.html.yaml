              - text: "Omorovicza's Evening Duo combines a multi-purpose serum with a
                  dual-effect face mask to leave skin looking brighter, smoother
                  and more even toned. The Set Contains: Acid Fix (30ml) A
                  multi-purpose serum ideal for damaged, dull and oily skin. The
                  formula aims to treat the damage caused upon skin by UV
                  radiation, environmental toxins and acne, utilising the
                  brand’s patented Healing Concentrate™ delivery system to
                  strengthen the skin surface, leaving it plumper, firmer and
                  smoother. A potent trio of Glycolic, Salicylic and Lactic
                  Acids works to remove dead cells, create a more even skin tone
                  and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles for a
                  more youthful complexion. Australian Caviar Lime Extract
                  restores radiance and softens the complexion, while Sodium
                  Hyaluronate replenishes and retains hydration to erase
                  dryness. The result is a brighter, healthier and
                  younger-looking complexion with a natural glow. Suitable for
                  dull, acne-prone and oily skin. Midnight Radiance Mask (50ml)
                  A dual-effect product to hydrate, brighten and transform skin
                  overnight. Fortified with the signature Hydro Mineral
                  Transference™ system for maximum efficacy, the thick,
                  gel-based formula melts into skin with a refreshing cooling
                  sensation, delivering an instant moisture boost with Red Algae
                  and Hyaluronic Acid helping restore elasticity levels and
                  create a plumping effect. Oil-regulating extracts of Black
                  Willow and Salicylic Acid then work together to slough away
                  dead skin cells and unclog pores with gentle chemical
                  exfoliation, resulting in a more even surface texture that
                  feels sumptuously softened and supple. The addition of Sand
                  Lily helps alleviate the appearance of dark spots and
                  discolouration for a more even and flawless tone. Awaken to a
                  rejuvenated and revitalised complexion, drenched with
                  much-needed moisture and left with a dewy, healthy-looking
                  radiance. Suitable for all skin types, in particular those
                  with hyperpigmentation or oiliness. Free from synthetic
                  fragrance, colours and parabens."
