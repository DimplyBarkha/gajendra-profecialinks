              - text: Dyson Small Ball Allergy Powerful performance on carpets and hard floors.
                  Captures more dust and allergens Your vacuum will suck up more
                  dirt molecules with Dyson’s 2 Tier RadialTM technology. This
                  double layer of cyclones creates more force, giving you
                  consistently powerful suction. So it’ll pick up dust that’s
                  buried deep in your carpets, so you can enjoy a cleaner,
                  fresher home. Powerful performance on all floors The epicyclic
                  drive cleaner head creates powerful suction to leave your
                  floors spotless. Three planetary gears work together with the
                  bristles in the brush bar, picking up fine dust and larger
                  debris. So whether you’re cleaning carpets or parquet
                  flooring, your whole home will look like new. Tackle dirt in
                  any room The lightweight design of this model makes it
                  effortless to clean from room to room. Weighing in at just
                  6.9kg, it’s much lighter than a traditional upright vacuum.
                  This means it’s easier to tackle jobs around the whole house,
                  as you won’t be hauling a heavy load up flights of stairs.
                  Move effortlessly round your furniture Clever Ball™ technology
                  lets you easily manoeuvre round obstacles and furniture. Its
                  special design has the main components inside the ball,
                  lowering the centre of gravity and creating a streamlined
                  shape. This means it’s light and easy to fit into tight
                  spaces, while steering is more accurate and turning corners is
                  effortless, letting you reach into every nook and cranny.
                  Peace of mind from the experts This model has been certified
                  asthma and allergy friendly by Allergy Standards Limited.
                  Thanks to its powerful suction and innovative brush bar, it
                  captures the finest dust particles from the air and the most
                  stubborn dirt from deep in your carpets. This helps to reduce
                  the number of allergens in your home, letting you breathe a
                  little easier. Whats in the box Dyson Small Ball Allergy
