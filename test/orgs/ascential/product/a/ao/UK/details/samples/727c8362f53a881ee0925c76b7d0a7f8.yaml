                  unpacking it – pull it out of the box using the edges so that
                  you don’t damage the screen. If you need to return your TV for
                  any reason, we just ask that you don’t pack the plug in front
                  of the screen as it could damage the TV in transit.

                  with the 3rd generation AI7 4K intelligent processor. The AI
                  technology analyses each frame and optimises the sharpness,
                  brightness and clarity, giving you flawless visuals in all of
                  your films. At the same time, it also tweaks the audio so that
                  it’ll sound just as good in rooms of all different shapes and
                  sizes. So, wherever you decide to place this TV, you’ll still
                  get that full cinematic feeling. Supports plenty of HDR
                  formats HDR takes viewing to the next level, delivering
                  incredibly vivid, life-like colour. By adjusting the
                  brightness of colours depending on the scene, it provides
                  subtler gradients and more detail, so every frame is
                  super-dynamic. LG’s Cinema HDR supports a variety of HDR
                  formats, including Dolby Vision IQ and HDR10 Pro, so you’re
                  guaranteed a more realistic picture onscreen. Get your game on
                  You’ll always get the most out of your favourite games thanks
                  to LG’s HGiG mode. It cleverly scans the TV’s picture quality
                  and performance, then fine tunes every little detail for a
                  breathtaking image full of colour and detail. So, you can dive
                  into a really immersive experience when you get stuck into a
                  new smash hit title, and enjoy smooth gameplay with no
                  interruptions. You only need to ask LG ThinQ AI lets you
                  control the TV, and do a whole host of other clever things
                  too, using just your voice. It has Google Assistant built-in,
                  so you’ll just need to speak for full control of the TV and
                  other smart devices in your home. That means whether you want
                  to dim the lights for movie night, or you see an advert for
                  shampoo and want to add it to a shopping list, you can simply
                  ask. A TV that waits for no one WebOS adds a whole lot of
                  convenience and colour to your TV’s menus. All the smart
                  features pop up at the bottom of the screen in attractively
                  vibrant shades, and thanks to the powerful processor, you can
                  flick between apps quickly while still bingeing a boxset. So,
                  if you remember that a new series of your favourite show has
                  just launched, it’ll only be two ticks before you’re sucked
                  into the action. Top TV tips Remember that a TV’s size in
                  inches is diagonal from corner to corner. So, if you're using
                  the stand, you’ll need to check the width of the TV in the
                  product specification to make sure it’ll fit on your
                  furniture. Check the feet too – if they’re at the edges of the
                  TV, make sure they’ll both fit on your TV stand.
