              - text: The Dyson Supersonic hair dryer offers the first real innovation to the
                  world of blow dryers in more than half a century. As a result,
                  you can decrease frizz and flyaways by 61%, while increasing
                  the smoothness and shine of your hair even more (by 75% and
                  132%, respectively).* Achieving these results was no small
                  feat. Dyson invested more than $71 million in its efforts to
                  bring a lighter, quieter, faster blow dryer into homes around
                  the world. Over 4 years, 103 enginers created around 100
                  patents and 600 prototypes in a quest for the perfect hair
                  care solution. The Dyson Supersonic hair dryer is the climax
                  of their tireless efforts.

              - text: Weighing less than 2 lbs, the Dyson blow dryer earns the distinction as
                  the fastest+ hairdryer on the market. Already among the
                  lightest options available, the Supersonic avoids the
                  “dumbbell effect” by housing its motor in the handle rather
                  than the head. Doing so allows you to comfortably style your
                  hair without tiring your arm out in the process. Three
                  precisely calibrated speed settings and four temperature
                  settings, including an 82 °F cold shot to help set your hair,
                  give you all the control needed to get your hair just right.
                  To avoid damage from extreme heat, the Dyson Supersonic
                  measures air temperature more than 40 times every second,
                  safeguarding your hair's natural shine. If you've ever been
                  frustrated by the noise, weight, or speed of your hairdryer,
                  the Dyson Supersonic is the answer you've been looking for.

                  attachments designed to style different hair types.
                  ||Lightweight and balanced: Dyson has turned convention on its
                  head and put the motor in the handle, completely rebalancing
                  the dryer's weight and shape. ||Magnetic attachments: Only the
                  Dyson Supersonic™ hair dryer comes with magnetic attachments,
                  so you can adjust quickly and easily. ||Acoustically tuned:
                  The powerful motor is tuned to produce one inaudible
                  frequency. ||Precise speed and heat settings: Delivers fast
                  drying and styling, regular drying, and gentle drying with a
                  constant cool flow. ||Negative ions: Help reduce static in the
                  hair. ||Cool to touch: With Heat Shield technology, the
                  surfaces of the attachments stay cool. Even during close-up
                  styling.||Magnetic styling attachments: Styling concentrator
                  The wide thin design of the Styling concentrator creates a
                  high-velocity blade of air that's perfect for styling.

                  helping to create a smooth, natural finish. Diffuser
                  Engineered to disperse air evenly around your curls, and
                  simulate natural drying, helping to reduce frizz and define
                  curls and waves. Long prongs allow you to style hair with
