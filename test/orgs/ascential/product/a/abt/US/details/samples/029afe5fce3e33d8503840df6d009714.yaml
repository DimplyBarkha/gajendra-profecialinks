              - text: The Dyson Supersonic hair dryer offers the first real innovation to the
                  world of blow dryers in more than half a century. As a result,
                  you can decrease frizz and flyaways by 61%, while increasing
                  the smoothness and shine of your hair even more (by 75% and
                  132%, respectively).* Achieving these results was no small
                  feat. Dyson invested more than $71 million in its efforts to
                  bring a lighter, quieter, faster blow dryer into homes around
                  the world. Over 4 years, 103 enginers created around 100
                  patents and 600 prototypes in a quest for the perfect hair
                  care solution. The Dyson Supersonic hair dryer is the climax
                  of their tireless efforts.

              - text: Weighing less than 2 lbs, the Dyson blow dryer earns the distinction as
                  the fastest+ hairdryer on the market. Already among the
                  lightest options available, the Supersonic avoids the
                  “dumbbell effect” by housing its motor in the handle rather
                  than the head. Doing so allows you to comfortably style your
                  hair without tiring your arm out in the process. Three
                  precisely calibrated speed settings and four temperature
                  settings, including an 82 °F cold shot to help set your hair,
                  give you all the control needed to get your hair just right.
                  To avoid damage from extreme heat, the Dyson Supersonic
                  measures air temperature more than 40 times every second,
                  safeguarding your hair's natural shine. If you've ever been
                  frustrated by the noise, weight, or speed of your hairdryer,
                  the Dyson Supersonic is the answer you've been looking for.
