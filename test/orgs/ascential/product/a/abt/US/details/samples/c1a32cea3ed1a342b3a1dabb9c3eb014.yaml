                  everywhere around your home. ||14 cyclones 14 cyclones
                  generate forces of more than 79,000g to fling microscopic
                  particles – such as pollen and bacteria – into the bin.
                  ||Whole-machine filtration The fully-sealed filtration system
                  traps 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns – expelling
                  cleaner air. ||Acoustically engineered Designed to absorb
                  vibrations and dampen noise, to keep sound levels down.
                  ||In-line configuration The motor, bin and cyclone are
                  aligned, so air is drawn into the cyclones in a straight line
                  – helping to create powerful Dyson suction.||Cleaner head:
