                  Safety Warning

                  IMPORTANT NOTICE: Breast milk is best for babies and breastfeeding should continue for as long as possible. Infant milks are suitable from birth when babies are not breastfed and should only be used on the advice of a doctor, midwife, health visitor, public health nurse, dietitian or pharmacist, or other professionals responsible for maternal and child care. When bottle-feeding, do not allow prolonged or frequent contact of milk feeds with teeth as this increases the risk of tooth decay. Ask your healthcare professional or dentist for advice. Always hold your baby while feeding. Do not leave baby unattended as they might choke.

                  This table is a guide only; your baby may need more or less than the volumes stated. If you require more advice, consult your healthcare professional. Remember to feed your baby on demand. Mix 1 scoop powder to 30 ml (approx. 1 fl. oz.) of water.

                  Approx. 186 scoops per can. 1 scoop = 4.3g

                  Important Feeding Information

                  Do not add extra powder or water to make feeds stronger or weaker and do not press powder into scoop. Using too much or too little powder can make your baby ill.

                  We recommend preparing each feed in individual bottles when required.

                  For hygienic reasons, discard unfinished feed in the bottle as soon as possible.

                  For older babies, made-up formulate can be added to food.

                  Do not alter or add to formulate unless medically directed.

                  Do not warm feeds in microwave, hot spots may occur and cause scalding.

                  Remember, cows' milk should not be used as a drink during the first year.

                  How to Open and Prepare Your Baby's Feed

                  Whilst this product is made under strict hygienic conditions, it is not sterile. Failure to follow instructions on preparation and storage may make your baby ill.

                  1 Pull the safety seal and open the lid. Lift the tab, pull on the foil seal, carefully and safely remove the seal and dispose of it. The scoop is provided under the foil seal.

                  2 Wash hands well. Wash and sterilise all utensils according to manufacturers' instructions.

                  3 Boil 1 litre of fresh tap water. Allow boiled water to cool for no more than 30 minutes. Measure the required amount of water (see feeding guide) into a sterilised bottle, carefully - the water is hot. Do not use artificially softened or repeatedly boiled water.

                  4 Using only the scoop provided, add the correct number of scoops of powder (see feeding guide), levelling off each scoop with the back of a clean dry knife. Replace lid on can.

                  5 Place the sterilised teat and cap on the bottle and shake well until powder is fully dissolved. Cool bottle under cold running water or in a bowl or jug of cold water until lukewarm, do not immerse the teat. Test temperature by shaking a few drops onto the inside of your wrist.

                  This table is a guide only; your baby may need more or less than the volumes stated. If you require more advice, consult your healthcare professional. Remember to feed your baby on demand. Mix 1 scoop powder to 30 ml (approx. 1 fl. oz.) of water.

                  Approx. 186 scoops per can. 1 scoop = 4.3g

                  Important Feeding Information

                  Do not add extra powder or water to make feeds stronger or weaker and do not press powder into scoop. Using too much or too little powder can make your baby ill.

                  We recommend preparing each feed in individual bottles when required.

                  For hygienic reasons, discard unfinished feed in the bottle as soon as possible.

                  For older babies, made-up formulate can be added to food.

                  Do not alter or add to formulate unless medically directed.

                  Do not warm feeds in microwave, hot spots may occur and cause scalding.

                  Remember, cows' milk should not be used as a drink during the first year.

                  How to Open and Prepare Your Baby's Feed

                  Whilst this product is made under strict hygienic conditions, it is not sterile. Failure to follow instructions on preparation and storage may make your baby ill.

                  1 Pull the safety seal and open the lid. Lift the tab, pull on the foil seal, carefully and safely remove the seal and dispose of it. The scoop is provided under the foil seal.

                  2 Wash hands well. Wash and sterilise all utensils according to manufacturers' instructions.

                  3 Boil 1 litre of fresh tap water. Allow boiled water to cool for no more than 30 minutes. Measure the required amount of water (see feeding guide) into a sterilised bottle, carefully - the water is hot. Do not use artificially softened or repeatedly boiled water.

                  4 Using only the scoop provided, add the correct number of scoops of powder (see feeding guide), levelling off each scoop with the back of a clean dry knife. Replace lid on can.

                  5 Place the sterilised teat and cap on the bottle and shake well until powder is fully dissolved. Cool bottle under cold running water or in a bowl or jug of cold water until lukewarm, do not immerse the teat. Test temperature by shaking a few drops onto the inside of your wrist.
