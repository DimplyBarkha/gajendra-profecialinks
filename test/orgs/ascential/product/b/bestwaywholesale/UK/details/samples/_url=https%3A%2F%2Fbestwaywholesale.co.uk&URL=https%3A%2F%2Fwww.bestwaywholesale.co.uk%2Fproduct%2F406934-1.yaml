              - text: Distinctively dark with a creamy head. Velvety finish. Guinness Draught is
                  one of the world's most iconic beers. It is a stout beer that
                  is truly Made of More™️. Famous for its smooth velvety texture
                  and unique surge and settle. This is our greatest innovation.
                  Truly unique. Perfectly balanced. Made of More. The sweetness
                  of the malt perfectly balances the bitterness of the hops
                  which are both beautifully complimented by the characteristic
                  flavour of our Guinness roasted barley Guinness brewers were
                  the first to introduce the combination of nitrogen and carbon
                  dioxide to draught beer. The result was Guinness Draught,
                  famous for its smooth velvety texture and unique surge and
                  settle.
