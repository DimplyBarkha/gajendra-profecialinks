              - text: An enchanted fusion between 100% Arabica coffee beans and premium Vanilla.
                  100% Arabica releases the unique Tia Maria fragrance thanks to
                  special cold brew extraction. Coffee exudes cacao and tobacco
                  notes providing the rich full bodied taste. Vanilla provides
                  softness and roundness with an hint of Jamaican rhum that
                  gives our body, depth and structure.
