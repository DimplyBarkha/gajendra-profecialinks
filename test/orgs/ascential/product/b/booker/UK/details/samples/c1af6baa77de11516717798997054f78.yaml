              - text: Important notice Breastfeeding is best for babies. Aptamil® Follow On Milk
                  is only for babies over 6 months, as part of a mixed diet. It
                  should not be used as a breastmilk substitute before 6 months.
                  The decision to start weaning including the use of this
                  product before 6 months should be made only on the advice of a
                  doctor, midwife, health visitor, public health nurse,
                  dietitian, pharmacist, or other professional responsible for
                  maternal and child care, based on baby's individual needs.
                  When bottle feeding do not allow prolonged or frequent contact
                  of milk feeds with your baby's teeth as this increases the
                  risk of tooth decay. Ask your healthcare professional or
                  dentist for advice. Make sure your baby's teeth are cleaned
                  after the last feed at night.
